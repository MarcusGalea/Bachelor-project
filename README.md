# Bachelor project: defect-detection on solar panles
 Research with the use of deep learning methods in finding defects on solar cell panels. Pictures of the solar cell panels will be taken using short-wave infrared light (SWIR). Feature extraction of the data set is also of interest in strengthening the deep learning model
